# Bike-sharing Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project is look at the feasibility of starting a bike-sharing service in the city of Des Moines.  We will use information gathered from a similar service already being utilized in New York City.  The data we used for analysis was ride data for NYC Citibike for the month of August.

## Analysis Results
Below are several metrics that were looked at in relation to the current bike-sharing service used in New York.  Below is a summary of those results.  They can also be viewed in Tableau at the following link:

### User Type:
![User_Type](https://github.com/adbauer06/Bike_Sharing/blob/main/Resources/User_Type.PNG)

This chart shows that of the total number of times the bike-sharing service was utilized in the month of August, the majority of these were by subscribers.  In this graph, customers represent those that used the service who were not registered subscribers.


### Users by Gender:
![Gender_Breakdown](https://github.com/adbauer06/Bike_Sharing/blob/main/Resources/Gender_Breakdown.PNG)

This chart shows the proportion of who is utilizing the bike-sharing service based on gender type.  Male users make up the vast majority of those that use the service, more than double that of female users. 


### Top Starting Locations:
![Top_Starting_Locations](https://github.com/adbauer06/Bike_Sharing/blob/main/Resources/Top_Starting_Locations.PNG)

This charts shows the most used starting locations.  The bike-sharing service is clearly used the most in the Manhatten area of New York, which is a popular area for both tourism, as well as a major business area.  


### Top Ending Locations:
![Top_Ending_Locations](https://github.com/adbauer06/Bike_Sharing/blob/main/Resources/Top_Ending_Locations.PNG)

This chart shows the most used ending locations.  Again, just like the top starting locations, the stations most used are in the Manhatten area.  


### Bike Checkout Times:
![Checkout_Times_for_Users](https://github.com/adbauer06/Bike_Sharing/blob/main/Resources/Checkout_Times_for_Users.PNG)

This chart shows the amount of time bikes were checked out for.  The vast majority of checkouts were for short amounts of time, mainly less than an hour with the vast majority between 10 and 20 minutes.  This seems to imply that most usage is around getting from one location to another as opposed to "touring".

### Checkout Times by Gender:
![Checkout_Times_by_Gender](https://github.com/adbauer06/Bike_Sharing/blob/main/Resources/Checkout_Times_by_Gender.PNG)

This chart also looks at checkout times, but by gender.  Checkout time data is fairly consistant between both male and female users.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour:
![Trips_by_Weekday_per_Hour](https://github.com/adbauer06/Bike_Sharing/blob/main/Resources/Trips_by_Weekday_per_Hour.PNG)

This graph shows the bike usage for each day of the week per hour.  The weekdays show the heaviest usage between 7:00 and 9:00 in the morning and again from 5:00 to 7:00 in the evening.  This would lead us to believe that there is a heavy usage for those traveling to and from work.  The weekends are showing heavier usage during the daytime hours.  This could support that they are used for recreational purposes during those times.


### Trips by Weekeday per Hour (By Gender):
![Trips_by_Weekday_Hour_by_Gender](Resources/Trips_by_Weekday_Hour_by_Gender.png)

This chart shows that the bike usage by day per hour is fairly consistant between genders.


### User Trips by Gender and Type per Weekday:
![Trips_by_Type_Gender_per_Weekday](Resources/Trips_by_Type_Gender_per_Weekday.png)

This chart shows the number of trips taken by user type and gender over the week.  Male subscribers make up the majority of the bike trips.  


## Summary and Recommendations
Looking at the New York City Citibike bike-sharing service, we can make the following observations that can be applied in looking at establishing a bike-sharing service in Des Moines.
- Subscribers make up a large majority of the user base of this service.  While non-subscribers can and do use the service also, having a large-base of subscribers may help with stability and being able to more easily ensure profitability.
- Men do tend to use the bike-sharing service much more frequently then women. The factors that contribute to this may be worthwhile looking into further in order to determine how to market to both groups.
- The majority of bike use in New York City is in areas with a high business concentration as well as tourist draws. Based on the charts depicting usage, the times of heaviest usage do coorespond with the typical times for communting to and from work.  There is also data that supports the possibility for more recreational use on weekends.
- Based on the checkout time data, people seem to use the bike-sharing service primarily as a mode of transportation from one location to another.


Recommendations
- Additional information that could be looked at is whether bike check-out times vary based on the days of the week or time of day.  Are bikes being checked out longer outside of those typical workday commute times?  This might give a better indicator as to whether bikes are primarily used for just short trips to a particular destination regardless of day and/or time, or whether there does seem to be times were bikes are checked out for longer durations for possibly recreational purposes.
- One metric we did not pull with this analysis was how many bikes were being used.  It might be interesting to look at how many bikes are being used at points in time in proporation to how many there are in total in order to determine the initial investment required.
